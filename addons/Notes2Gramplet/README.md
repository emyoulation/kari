# Notes2 Gramplet
v0.9.0<br>

This is a slightly modified version of the regular Notes gramplet found by default at the bottom bar.

The changes are:

1. Possible performance improvement. For some reason displaying the note is very slow if the note is large (over 100 lines or so). This happens at least on my Linux system. However, I did not notice the slowness on Windows.

1. There is an "Edit" button that allows the user to edit the currently visible note. Or create a new note if there are not yet any:
