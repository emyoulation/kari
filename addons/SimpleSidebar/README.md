This is an addon that creates a new (left) sidebar for Gramps. The sidebar contains just a flat list of all views for all categories so you can select a view with a single click.

You can activate this sidebar from the bottom left corner:

For clarity, the different categories (Dashboard, People etc) are separated by extra 10 pixel empty space. Long labels are split to multiple lines:

Without the text labels:
